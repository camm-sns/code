# Case 1: Run DAKOTA in parallel and launch M-1 serial analysis jobs at once

# In an M processor allocation, by default DAKOTA will configure with
# a master scheduler with M-1 slave analysis processes.  Overriding
# this with static_scheduling will avoid this dedicated master and use
# all M processors, but then each batch of M analyses will have to
# complete before the next M are scheduled.  This may be useful if all
# evaluations are known to take the same processor time:
